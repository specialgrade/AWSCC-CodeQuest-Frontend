                        <p class="info">Located behind The Leaky Cauldron pub, Diagon Alley was the main shopping street for the UK’s wizarding community. With its ancient buildings and cobbled streets, Diagon Alley was often a busy place, particularly before term started as Hogwarts students rushed to get the books and equipment on their back-to-school lists.</p>

                        <h3>Hogwarts</h3>
                        <p class="info">Located in a huge sprawling castle in the Scottish highlands, the celebrated school of witchcraft and wizardry taught its young students how to finesse their magical skills. From the tallest turrets and towers down to the depths of the dungeons (with 142 staircases between them), Hogwarts is structurally supported by magic, and even the school's headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, doesn’t claim to know all of its secrets!</p>

Guarded by Dementors, life at Azkaban was notoriously brutal with many of its inhabitants losing their minds over the course of their sentence.</p>
